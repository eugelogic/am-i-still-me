Right: now ,I know my physical rehab has finished and despite that I still have my huge perceptual problems such as when I am manoeuvring between chair s in a restaurant, and as well there is the lack of any sensation in my hand which makes; having any dexterity impossible because I need to be able to look at my hand or see my fingers to know what they are doing and sure my hand is marginally better than a club but it is only marginal
And I must admit that my rehab has been a long period of time where I am just feeling constantly exhausted but. I, just feel I have so much still to work on and I cannot sit around vegetating ;after all I did that exceptionally well, when I was in hospital in my coma and I am constantly accused of being impatient but I just reply that patience is for people in hospital and I know that sitting around will do absolutely nothing for my rehab and I am most definitely not a troglodyte after all I have too much so much to work on I just feel I am obliged to do very thing I can possibly do to get better and whilst thereâ€™s still something to do I feel I cannot relax and I do also wonder if this is the reason I am so desperate to be with l my wife again because that will signify so much for me. I will truly be able to put this whole very sorry saga in the past And it is also why I need to have a new girlfriend because it is not normal to keep on the go literally every second of the day every minute of every day and when I say on the go I mean I am chopping up my vegetables for my supper and this is mostly just because it allows me to practice using my left hand and it is also why I like vegetables so much and whilst I am planning what to eat I think about what is good for my hand, because I am most certainly not a vegan or a kiddy torturer(as I prefer to call the vegans- I mean what Parent Takes their kid to a beach and does not let them have an ice-cream , and for instance when I go for a run or a walk I hold a sweat band in my left hand the bugger , just so that I can practice using the bugger and holding an object such that I am trying to manipulate the objects in my hand trying to move the object in my palm or around my palm so that I am using different aspects of my hand and I am not a robot as much as I must sound like one at the moment at the ,moment because I mean just think about it . who in their fright mind would design a robot as fucked as me. So, this morning I went for a run and it was another cracker of day I faliforna as I like to call Falmouth. and whilst running sure I was still manipulating the object in my bugger. But I could at least appreciate that it was a glorious winters morning and the sun was slowly rising above the horizon which was the sea, an azure blue in the e distance with the e glorious sun shine a bright yellow orange slither separating the blighter and brighter blue of the sky from the more moody blue of the sea in the distance and I just need to be able to rest- be that with liv or with someone else , and someone wo I can enjoy these infinitesimally small victories with like when I beat one of the scares at chess or my son I will finally be able to sit down and relax with her. . and it is this sort of determination that I am very thankful for because I would just be proving those buggers and supposed experts correct, who all wrote me off as being a vegetable or worse in a persistent vegetive, state and one of my colleagues said to my wife that there was only about a 30percent chance of me ever being able to dress myself independanyly again: I mean what complete load of rubbish I mean 30% where on earth did he get that statistic from well I can answer that for you he got it from a place where the sun does not shine my god my life is so difficult just now because of all the extra work I need to do just to give the appearance of functioning normally and I use one of my colleagues statistic every time I am struggling to do up my buttons on my shirt to spur me on but I feel I have not been left with any choice and so this is another reason why I am so hard on myself such that when I get up from the chair my left leg is always slow to kick in and it means I can Also topple over to my left side so I need to recognise this as a possibility and I guess j that just now is all I need to do is to recognise it as a possibility and this is some of the reason that I am told I am so unusual but I hasten to add that it is only some of the reason and even I can see that my rehab has almost come to an end but I would argue that I am far from the finished article as much as any an Australian can ever be a finished article unless of course you are referring to me when I was lying nearly dead by the roadside in st Mawes well then. I could certainly be described as being almost a finished article and I am definitely not
And I guess I am getting slightly sick of all the compliments I am receiving about my recovery but I just see a body that is still buggered and Although I am better and alive now no one can dispute that not even me but I want so much more than what I have now and I just see people who are paid to be around me or people who are so worried about me And can and cannot do. As opposed to just being like any other adult. Who just gets on with their day. but I do not see anything remarkable because this is just the hand that I have been dealt and I have just had to do the best I can with it. I had no choice as I see it; it was deal with it or give up, and die and in many ways, I was too selfish to die because I wanted to see my kids some more and I still harboured some desire for my wife and I still do but even I have to accept that boat Has sailed. But still I just feel a very strong desire to be with liv again and I felt that I had married her for life and I am desperately sorry that liv sees it as a sentence but what can one do. And all through this I I have also been desperately trying to not think about what we could have been and what we could have done for our children I and we are just more bricks in the head injury wall. And despite being one who has possibly defied the experts but what is an expert when their field is one so poorly understood or so little is known how far one can recover and it is this that I hope will give some people some greater knowledge about brain injury or some greater hope. And the key is to have the determination and perseverance and as I am at the end of my physical rehab what if liv and I well I think that we are still very very good friends with a very good history, and I just think that we were so very strong on n our wedding day but we were just two very very small people confronted with a catastrophic train crash and I also hasten to add tthat liv is much smaller than me standing in at a diminutive 5 foot 6
